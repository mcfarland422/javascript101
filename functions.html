// functions are just blocks of code that can be called/used whenever you please
// 1. They are first class objects... you can do anything to a function that you can do to any other object.
// 2. they have their own scope. I.e., it is a child of whoever it's inside of.
// Children can see their parents stuff, and can override their parents stuff.
// 3. Like all other variables, if it's not inside of something, it belongs to the global scope, or window.
// 4. They can return a single value (can be an object, array)

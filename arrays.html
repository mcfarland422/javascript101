<script type="text/javascript">

  var students = [];
  students = ["Jennifer","Nicolas","Zach"];
  // append = push
  students.push("Taylor");
  students.push("Hayes");

  //Every array has a length property. That is always accessible.
  // This is the same as doing len(students)
  console.log(students.length)

  Like python and everyone else, the first index is 0.
  any data type can go in
